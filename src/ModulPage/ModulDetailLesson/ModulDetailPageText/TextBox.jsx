Oslo, the capital, has about 650,000 inhabitants. The metropolitan area, which includes the densely populated areas around Oslo proper, has 1.7 million people.</p> 
                <p>In Norway all political parties basically agree that the quality of health, education and social services should be as similar as possible throughout the country. </p>
                <p>The Norwegian welfare state has the following general characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Benefits and services are financed through a re-distributive, general tax system. Those with lower incomes pay relatively less and those with higher incomes (up to a limit) pay relatively more. </li>
                        <li>The welfare system is founded on the ideals of equality, social justice, social security, solidarity and social integration. These ideals are subject to positive and negative tensions. </li>
                        <li>The goals of economic redistribution and social integration require high employment and economically active people. </li>
                        <li>The focus on employment and employability may clash with the ideals of equality, social justice and social security.  </li>
