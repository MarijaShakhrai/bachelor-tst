    "The Norwegian Welfare State Ideals in tension Norway is a thin, stretched country in Scandinavia. It has a population of only 5 million people. Oslo, the capital, has about 650,000 inhabitants. The metropolitan area, which includes the densely populated areas around Oslo proper, has 1.7 million people.In Norway all political parties basically agree that the quality of health, education and social services should be as similar as possible throughout the country.The Norwegian welfare state has the following general characteristics: Benefits and services are financed through a re-distributive, general tax system. Those with lower incomes pay relatively less and those with higher incomes (up to a limit) pay relatively more.The welfare system is founded on the ideals of equality, social justice, social security, solidarity and social integration. These ideals are subject to positive and negative tensions. The goals of economic redistribution and social integration require high employment and economically active people. The focus on employment and employability may clash with the ideals of equality, social justice and social security. Resources Wikipedia. Oslo. World Population Review. Oslo population 2018.
